# HR Portal app

This app is created using ReactJS.
The approach here is to create a single page application as there are only two things to render on request, one is employee details and another is to do list.
As I am not using routing in this app, the employee information is shown on the same page below searchbar and the to do list is displayed in HTML overlay.

I have tried using Mocha and Chai for testing the application but I am trying to get the configuration settings for babel and webpack right to be working with Mocha.

The deployed version of this website can be found at https://devaniketjadhav.github.io/hr_portal

To run the website locally, you need to have nodeJs installed on your machine.
Simply download the repo and in the terminal at project folder, execute following commands.
```
npm i
npm run dev
```
